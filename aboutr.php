OUR MISSION <big>is to create thoughtful, beautiful interiors that meet our clients aesthetic, functional, and economic goals while honoring and celebrating the buildings that contain them.</big><Br><br><br><br>

OUR PERSPECTIVE <big>is informed by a respect for historical architecture coupled with an appreciation of the playfulness and  brightness of modern design.</big><br><br>

OUR EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE <big>applies to all types of projects: on smaller residential and renovation work we can produce the drawings necessary for permitting and construction, <br><br>Mon larger commercial and new-construction projects we focus on the interiors and work in tandem with architectural and engineering teams.</big><br><br><br>

OUR APPROACH<big> is flexible and responsive. We work with some clients who have a strong vision and we help them achieve it. <br><br> Others are less sure and we guide them through the design process, helping them to formulate their own aesthetic as we go.</big><br><br><br>

OUR NETWORK<big> of collaborating professionals, formed through fifteen years of practice, includes architects, builders, artists, and artisans who share our vision.</big><br><br><br>

WE ARE BASED IN PORTLAND, OREGON <big>but we are currently working on projects in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and other cities in the US.<br> <br>We enjoy the diversity and learning opportunities offered by working in communities other than our own.</big>
